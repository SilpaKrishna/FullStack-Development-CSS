        <h1>CSS Selectors, Properties, and Values </h1>
        <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>
        <p>The property is the color piece of this declaration. It dictates which aspect of the selector will be changed visually.</p>
